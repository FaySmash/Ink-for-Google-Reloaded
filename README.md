# Ink-for-Google-Reloaded
This is a Collection of Userstyles to give Google Websites more Colors back! The Idea is based on the 'Ink for Google' Addon. I created those Userstyles to imitate the old style (before Material Design 2.0) the Ink for Google Addon gave Googles Websites (hence the name).

**The Styles come with various design settings**
